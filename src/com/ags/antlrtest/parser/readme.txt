To compile the grammar file and the generated JAVA file run 

./build.sh

This should generate all the JAVA parser and lexer files that 
and compile those into CLASS files

To test the parser use 

./test.sh  testfile

where testfile is a text file with the script to test

This should display a GUI java window with the generated AST.
